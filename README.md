Some parts of this wouldn't have been possible without reverse engineering help from the nwdb discord, particularly Xyo and jesspacito, who helped with gs-based damage and finding a formuala for crit chance that doesnt rely on simulation.
Also thanks to MorrolanTV,MixedNuts, CarpetMerchant, XR and others from the morrolan discord who helped with providing test data and who've done no small part in untangling the mess that is new world themselves.
